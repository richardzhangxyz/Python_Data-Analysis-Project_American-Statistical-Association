# Python_Data-Analysis-Project_American-Statistical-Association
The project is inspired by the 2021 Fall Data Challenge from the American Statistical Association (ASA). You can find information about it here: https://thisisstatistics.org/falldatachallenge/

The goal of the ASA Data challenge is to encourage contestants to "tackle the increasing challenge of food scarcity and insecurity in the United States". The project is based on the Food Access Research Atlas dataset. Information about the data can be found here (there is an overview, a link to the dataset etc.):
